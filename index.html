            <h2>What</h2>

            <p>In East Asian countries it is common to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@37.5621801,127.0373248,17z">number subway exits</a> (<strong>出口</strong>). These numbers link the subway station to the surrounding streets, making it easy to navigate between them.</p>
            
            <p>Numbered exits make it easier to <strong>know which exit is closest to where you want to go</strong>. You can make sure that you don't exit from the wrong end of the station (always a pain).</p>
            
            <p>It is easier to <strong>give directions</strong> with numbered exits. Businesses could list not only the closest subway station, but also the closest station exit to their location. Friends can agree to meet at a specific exit.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Why don't Western subway systems have numbered exits?</strong></p>
            
            <h2>How</h2>

            <p>It would be easy to set up a system that would uniquely identify each exit and give riders information about each exit's relative position. For example, we could number each station exit in a clockwise order starting from the north-eastern most exit.</p>
